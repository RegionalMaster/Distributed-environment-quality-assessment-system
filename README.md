# AirwiseConnection: A Low-Cost Edge Computing Solution for Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring

## Abstract

This paper presents AirwiseConnection, an innovative edge computing-based air quality monitoring system that combines Internet of Things (IoT) sensor technology with modern web architecture. The system provides real-time monitoring of multiple air quality parameters including PM2.5, PM10, CO2, Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), temperature, and humidity. By leveraging edge computing and low-power Bluetooth technology, the system achieves high efficiency while maintaining low energy consumption and cost-effectiveness. We describe the system architecture, implementation details, and potential applications in environmental monitoring and public health.

## 1. Introduction

Air quality monitoring has become increasingly important in both indoor and outdoor environments due to its direct impact on human health and well-being. Traditional monitoring systems often lack real-time capabilities, require complex infrastructure, or consume excessive energy. AirwiseConnection addresses these limitations by providing a user-friendly, energy-efficient monitoring solution that leverages edge computing and modern web technologies.

The system utilizes edge computing principles to process data locally, reducing cloud dependency and minimizing latency in real-time monitoring. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth usage and associated costs while enabling offline functionality and ensuring data privacy through local processing. Energy efficiency is achieved through the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for sensor communication, optimized data sampling rates, efficient client-side processing, and minimal network transmission requirements.

## 2. System Architecture

The AirwiseConnection system architecture comprises two main components: the hardware sensor array with its associated microcontroller unit, and the software stack that processes and presents the data. This section details the technical implementation of both components and their integration.

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Hardware Architecture

The hardware implementation centers around a carefully selected array of low-cost, high-precision sensors integrated with an energy-efficient microcontroller unit. At the core of the particulate matter sensing is the PMS7003 sensor, which employs laser scattering technology to detect particles ranging from 0.3 to 10 micrometers in diameter. This sensor achieves a measurement range of 0-500μg/m³ with 1μg/m³ resolution while maintaining remarkably low power consumption—drawing only 100mA during active sensing and dropping to 200μA in standby mode.

Carbon dioxide monitoring is accomplished through the SCD30 sensor, which utilizes NDIR dual-channel technology to provide highly accurate CO2 measurements. The sensor operates across a range of 400-10000ppm with an accuracy of ±(30ppm + 3%). Its power consumption is optimized at 19mA average draw, and it features automatic self-calibration capabilities that ensure long-term measurement stability.

For volatile organic compound detection, we employ the SGP30 multi-pixel gas sensor. This advanced sensor can detect TVOC concentrations up to 60000ppb and includes on-chip humidity compensation for improved accuracy. Environmental conditions are monitored using the SHT31 sensor, providing temperature measurements accurate to ±0.3°C and relative humidity readings with ±2% RH accuracy.

The system's brain is the ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller, featuring a dual-core Xtensa® 32-bit LX6 microprocessor operating at 240 MHz. This powerful yet efficient processor is equipped with 520 KB of SRAM and 4 MB of flash storage, providing ample space for both program execution and data storage. The ESP32's integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities are crucial for our implementation, while its sophisticated power management system allows for various operating modes—from full-power operation at 160-260mA to deep-sleep drawing only 10μA.

### 3.2 Power Management System

Power efficiency is achieved through a sophisticated management system built around an LDO regulator providing stable 3.3V supply with over 90% efficiency. The system implements dynamic frequency scaling and sensor duty cycling, automatically adjusting power consumption based on monitoring requirements. This adaptive approach ensures optimal power usage while maintaining system responsiveness.

### 3.3 Software Architecture

The software implementation employs modern web technologies to create a responsive and efficient user interface while handling complex data processing at the edge. The frontend is built using React 18 with TypeScript, providing robust type safety and improved development efficiency. The application architecture follows a component-based design pattern, utilizing React's latest features including hooks for state management and effect handling.

State management is implemented through a combination of React Query for server state and custom hooks for local state management. This hybrid approach allows for efficient handling of real-time data streams while maintaining a responsive user interface. React Query provides automatic background refetching, cache invalidation, and optimistic updates, crucial for real-time air quality monitoring.

### 3.4 Edge Computing Implementation

The edge computing implementation in AirwiseConnection represents a sophisticated approach to local data processing and storage. At its core, the system implements a structured data pipeline that processes raw sensor data into actionable information. The core data structure for sensor readings is defined as follows:

```typescript
interface SensorData {
    timestamp: number;      // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
    pm25: number;          // PM2.5 in μg/m³
    pm10: number;          // PM10 in μg/m³
    co2: number;           // CO2 in ppm
    tvoc: number;          // TVOC in ppb
    temperature: number;    // Temperature in °C
    humidity: number;      // Relative humidity in %
}
```

This data structure serves as the foundation for all sensor communications and data processing operations. The complete data processing pipeline, including AQI calculations and health index generation, is detailed in Appendix A.

### 3.5 Data Storage Architecture

The system implements a multi-tiered storage strategy optimized for time-series data. The storage configuration is defined through a structured interface:

```typescript
interface StorageConfig {
    dbName: string;
    storeName: string;
    retention: number;     // Days to retain data
    maxEntries: number;    // Maximum entries per store
}
```

This configuration drives the entire storage system, which includes IndexedDB for time-series data, LocalStorage for configuration, and Cache API for offline functionality. The complete storage implementation, including data retention policies and pruning strategies, is provided in Appendix B.

### 3.6 BLE Communication Protocol

The Bluetooth Low Energy communication protocol uses a compact packet structure for efficient data transmission:

```typescript
interface BLEPacket {
    header: number;      // 1 byte: packet type and flags
    length: number;      // 1 byte: payload length
    payload: Uint8Array; // Variable length: sensor data
    checksum: number;    // 1 byte: CRC-8
}
```

This packet structure ensures efficient data transmission while maintaining data integrity through checksum validation. The complete BLE protocol implementation, including GATT service specifications and packet handling, is detailed in Appendix C.

### 3.7 Power Management Implementation

The power management system operates based on a simple but effective state model:

```typescript
interface PowerState {
    mode: 'active' | 'idle' | 'sleep';
    currentDraw: number;  // mA
    voltage: number;      // V
}
```

This state model drives the dynamic power adjustment system. The full implementation of power management algorithms, including temperature monitoring and frequency scaling, is provided in Appendix D.

## 4. Results and Discussion
